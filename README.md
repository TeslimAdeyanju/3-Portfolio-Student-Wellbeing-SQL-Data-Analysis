# 💼 Using Data to Uncover Trends in Student Well-being Based on Stay Length"

This project analyzes the relationship between **student stay duration** and their well-being metrics using SQL. The well-being metrics include:
- **PHQ (Physical Health Questionnaire)**
- **SCS (Social Connectedness Scale)**
- **AS (Anxiety Scale)**

The dataset is explored to uncover trends, including how stay duration impacts physical health, social connectedness, and anxiety levels. This analysis helps in understanding key factors that affect student well-being, providing actionable insights for educational and mental health professionals.

## 📑 Project Overview

This SQL analysis focuses on the following:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Cleaning the data and ensuring all values are valid for analysis.
2. **Querying**: Using SQL queries to aggregate and analyze the data based on stay duration.
3. **Data Visualization**: Presenting results through clear visualizations to highlight trends in the data.

---

## 🚀 Key Insights
- **PHQ Scores**: Shorter stays are associated with lower physical health scores, indicating that students staying for shorter durations may report fewer health issues.
- **SCS & AS Scores**: Social connectedness and anxiety levels fluctuate more with shorter stays. In particular, anxiety (AS) scores tend to be higher for shorter stay durations.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: For querying and aggregating data.
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)**: For additional data manipulation and visualization.
