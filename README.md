# 💼 **Uncovering Trends in Student Well-being Based on Stay Duration**

This project explores the relationship between **student stay duration** and their well-being metrics using SQL and Python for analysis and visualization. By focusing on physical health, social connectedness, and anxiety levels, the goal is to uncover trends that can inform educational institutions and mental health professionals.

### 📑 **Project Overview**

This analysis provides insights into how stay duration impacts student well-being. It is structured as follows:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Ensuring all data is clean, accurate, and ready for analysis.
2. **SQL Queries**: Extracting and analyzing key data points to identify trends.
3. **Data Visualization**: Presenting insights through clear and impactful visualizations.

---

### 🚀 **Key Findings**
- **Physical Health (PHQ)**: Shorter stays often correlate with lower physical health scores, suggesting that students staying for shorter durations may experience fewer health issues.
- **Social Connectedness & Anxiety (SCS & AS)**: There is greater fluctuation in social connectedness and anxiety scores for shorter stays, with anxiety being notably higher.

### 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **SQL**: For data aggregation and querying.
- **Python**: Leveraging libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for further data analysis and visualization.
